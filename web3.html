                <p> When you’re on a tour of Rome and set your eyes on the Colosseum for the first time, it’s only
                    natural to ask yourself, “How old is the Roman Colosseum?” This marvel of ancient Roman engineering
                    is over 1,900 years old. Construction began in 72 A.D. and finished in 80 A.D. That means it only
                    took eight years to build.

                    This Colosseum is inextricably tied to Rome’s cityscape, and traveler Simonette perfectly captured
                    the feeling of experiencing all that history. “Seeing the city’s architecture, walls, arches, wells…
                    and more that are thousands of years old? B.C. and A.D., it was awesome and surreal!! I still have
                    chills just thinking about it.”</p>
